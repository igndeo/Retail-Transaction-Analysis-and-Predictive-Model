3.  Data Science Test
a.	Demand Forecast
Situation  The CEO also expects you to do some demand forecasting, predict how the company will do in terms of sales in the next few months, and identify what products need to be stocked up.
Tasks  You are expected to create an analysis and demand prediction based on the dataset on the next 6 months, remember to not only create a model but ensure that there’s some analysis and insight on why it’s happening, and call-to-action on what should we do to make it better, share what model you used, how you evaluated your models, how confident are you with the models and what are the caveat/issues you faced during the analysis

b.	Customer 360
Situation  The Sales Director is planning to implement a more personalized campaign for their customers to increase the company’s customer retention rate. They plan to invest in promotional activities for customers who are deemed valuable. Furthermore, they intend to double down on the amount spent on customers who have not been as active as before.
Tasks  You are expected to share insights and a pilot plan to increase the customer retention rate. Your task includes creating a model to identify which customers are predicted to have a high value and which customers are likely to churn. You are also encouraged to create an analysis and proposal on what you think the company should do, utilizing machine learning. (Plus point, not mandatory, you can also help the Sales Director with the personalization by recommending the right product for the right users, or in short: what products we should offer to them)
